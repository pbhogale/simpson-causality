# Simpson's paradox and causality

Simpson's paradox
---

**"A phenomena whereby the association between a pair of variables $(X, Y)$  reverses sign upon conditioning of a third variable, $Z$, $\forall \text{ }Z$."**

> If we partition the data into subpopulations, each representing a specific value of the third variable, the phenomena appears as a sign reversal between the associations measured in the disaggregated subpopulations relative to the aggregated data, which describes the population as a whole.
